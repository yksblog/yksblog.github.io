<h1 class="title">英语期末小结</h1>
<p>
　　I want to say that I like English very much.But I have a poor English greeds . In this sector I think that it is intersting to study English -speaking and English -listening . And I also think how frustrating English -writting is . On the moment I like English , on the other moment I feel sacred at English . If only there are not English test .
</p>

<p>
　　As we all know , English writting is very important to us students . I think that it isn't only difficult but also couldn't be beyonded . I feel there is white all in my head when I see one wrtting , so I don 't know what to do next .
</p>

<p>
　　In next sector , I only want to learn the English writting well .And I hope also my English test will pass on !
